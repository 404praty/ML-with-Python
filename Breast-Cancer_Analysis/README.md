# Data Generation and Breast Cancer Analysis

This repository contains two Python scripts: `generate.py` and `breast-cancer_analysis.py`. These scripts are used for generating random data and performing breast cancer analysis using machine learning techniques, respectively.

## `generate.py`

This script generates random data and saves it to a CSV file.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
```
python generate.py

```

### Output

The generated data is saved to a file named `random_samples.csv` in the current directory.

## `breast-cancer_analysis.py`

This script performs breast cancer analysis using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
```
python breast-cancer_analysis.py


```

### Prerequisites

This script requires the `scikit-learn` library to be installed. You can install it using the following command:
```
pip install scikit-learn

```


### Input

The script expects a CSV file named `new_samples.csv` to be present in the current directory. This file should contain the random data generated by the `generate.py` script.

### Output

The analysis results, including the predicted class names, are saved to a file named `store.csv` in the current directory.
