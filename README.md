## Introduction

In this repository, I will be uploading my code files and projects as I explore different machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python. Each code file or project focuses on a specific concept or application within the field of machine learning.

Feel free to explore the code and projects to gain insights into machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation methods, and more. You can use the code as a reference, modify it, or build upon it for your own machine learning projects.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Each code file is self-contained and can be executed independently. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (mentioned in the next section) before running the code.

## Dependencies

The code in this repository depends on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your Python environment before running the code. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

```



## Projects

### Project 1: Breast Cancer Analysis using KNN Algorithm

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to classify breast cancer samples as either malignant or benign based on various features.

The project includes the following files:

- `generate.py`: This file generates random samples of breast cancer data and saves them to a CSV file for analysis.

- `breast_cancer_analysis.py`: This file loads the breast cancer dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, applies the KNN algorithm for classification, and evaluates the model's performance. It saves the predicted class names to a CSV file.

- `random_samples.csv`: This CSV file contains randomly generated breast cancer samples.

- `store.csv`: This CSV file stores the predicted class names from the analysis.

Feel free to explore the project and its files for more details.
