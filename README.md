## Introduction

In this repository, I will be uploading my code files and projects as I explore different machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python. Each code file or project focuses on a specific concept or application within the field of machine learning.

Feel free to explore the code and projects to gain insights into machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation methods, and more. You can use the code as a reference, modify it, or build upon it for your own machine learning projects.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Each code file is self-contained and can be executed independently. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (mentioned in the next section) before running the code.

## Dependencies

The code in this repository depends on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your Python environment before running the code. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

```



## Projects

### Project 1: Breast Cancer Analysis using KNN Algorithm

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to classify breast cancer samples as either malignant or benign based on various features.

The project includes the following files:

- `generate.py`: This file generates random samples of breast cancer data and saves them to a CSV file for analysis.

- `breast_cancer_analysis.py`: This file loads the breast cancer dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, applies the KNN algorithm for classification, and evaluates the model's performance. It saves the predicted class names to a CSV file.

- `random_samples.csv`: This CSV file contains randomly generated breast cancer samples.

- `store.csv`: This CSV file stores the predicted class names from the analysis.

### Project 2: CIFAR-10 Object Detection using Random Forest

This project focuses on performing object detection on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Random Forest algorithm. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to train a Random Forest classifier to classify images into their respective object categories.

The project includes the following files:

- `cifar10.py`: This file contains the code to download and load the CIFAR-10 dataset using pickle. It pre-processes the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest classifier, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's accuracy and score. It also counts the predictions by label and displays the counts in a bar graph using Matplotlib.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions on how to use the code.

- `cifar10_plot.png`: This file is a sample bar graph generated by the code, showing the counts of predictions by label.

Feel free to explore the code and the dataset to gain insights into object detection techniques using the Random Forest algorithm.

Please note that the code provided in this project assumes the existence of the CIFAR-10 dataset files and uses the `pickle` module for loading the data. If you have made any modifications or have additional files related to the CIFAR-10 object detection project, please update the description accordingly.

### Project 3: Naive Bayes Classifier for Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence or absence of diabetes using a Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset used contains features related to glucose and blood pressure. The goal is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on these features.

The project includes the following files:

- `dbts_NB.py`: This file contains the code to load the diabetes dataset, split it into training and testing sets, create a Naive Bayes classifier, train the classifier, make predictions on the test set, and evaluate the model's accuracy. It also visualizes the data using a scatter plot.

- `Naive-Bayes-Classification-Data.csv`: This CSV file contains the diabetes dataset with the following columns: glucose, bloodpressure, and diabetes.

- `NB_Readme.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions on how to use the code.

### Project 4: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project focuses on implementing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It involves training a CNN model on a dataset of images and classifying them into various categories. The project explores various CNN architectures, data augmentation techniques, and model evaluation methods. The code includes loading the dataset, creating and training the CNN model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.

Please note that the detailed code and files for "Project 4" are not provided in the given README.md. The above description serves as a placeholder to indicate that Project 4 is related to image classification using CNNs. You can further develop the project and update the README.md with specific code files, dependencies, and additional details.




Feel free to explore the project and its files for more details.
